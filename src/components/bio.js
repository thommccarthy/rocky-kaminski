          Rocky Kaminski is an immersive sci-fi apocabilly jazz experience that
          will thrill you. Born in the 1980â€™s near a perpetually burning coal
          mine fire in rural PA, Rocky had few ambitions in life aside from
          making licks on his guitar. Strapped for cash as a young man, he
          participated in a clinical trial for experimental anti-aging drugs
          that caused him to live well into the 22nd century and meet
          multi-instrumentalist Quasaria Bognes. A time-traveling garbage truck
          transports them to gigs throughout the fabric of spacetime, where they
          dazzle audiences with a band of superpowered musicians, telling tales
          of a future dystopia.
